# Work Day Scheduler


## Repository Description

This repository contains code that I refactored to create a work day scheduler that uses localStorage to persist across page reloads. The original code was a basic HTML outline, CSS, and links to third-party APIs (e.g. Bootstrap, Moment.js, Font Awesome, and Google Fonts). My contribution to this project was to update the HTML with a Bootstrap grid to create a work day calendar and implement the CSS and third-party APIs given to me. 

Upon clicking a link to the work day scheduler, today's date will appear at the top of the page. If you are using this work day scheduler during the work day (9 AM to 5 PM local time), the time blocks will be color coded to indicate whether the time block is in the past, present, or future. To use this work day scheduler, type a task into one of the time blocks and then hit the save button for that time. Once you hit save, your task will be saved into localStorage so that your tasks persist across page reloads.

## Challenge Reflection

This is my first time working with third-party APIs. During this project I learned how to read through the API documentation to understand how to use and manipulate data. For this project specifically, I dove into Moment.js to include today's date at the top of the page and to color code the time blocks. Similarly, I used Bootstrap to create a grid for the schedule itself and Font Awesome and Google Fonts for various fonts. Going forward, I will use these and other APIs to improve the quality of my software and lean on my experience gained from this project when reading and interpreting API documentation.
